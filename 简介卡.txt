应要拆出来的单独模组，没有全部画完原作的东西，后面会补
The individual modules that should be dismantled have not been fully drawn from the original work, and will be supplemented later

家具目录在木匠那里，免费的
The furniture catalog is at the carpenter's place, free of charge

壁纸和地板在原版目录里面
Wallpaper and flooring are in the original catalog

床能用，贴图问题有点卡脚，这个不好改，因为床是比正常尺寸大的
The bed can be used, but the texture issue is a bit stuck. It's not easy to change because the bed is larger than the normal size

地板放上去错位是FF的问题，睡一觉就好了
The misalignment of the floor is an issue with FF, just take a nap and it will be fine
